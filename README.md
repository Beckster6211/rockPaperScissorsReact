<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# rockPaperScissorsReact

## School of Code Week 1 Day 5 Improved...

### What to do

During School of Code Hackathons are done to exercise what we have learned.

This is what we had to do for the first Hackathon of creating a Rock Paper Scissors game.

This task was to help with using basic HTML and vanilla JS.
It focused on dom manipulation to display the relevate information.

We also had to use functions to generate the computers random move. As well as statements to monitor the scoring generating a response when got to a specific number.

### What I did Originally

This isn't actually what I manage to accomplish by the end of that day/week one (I struggled a bit)

Me and my partner manage to get the concept of the game working but only in the console as messages.

I went back to the hackathon on occasion and atleast completed the main concept of it so the result are displayed on the screen (with the dom manipulation).

### How I improved

I have changed this so that you can pick what the players options are with buttons for each one instead of having to type it into an input field. This improvement makes it more playable and easier to follow.

I have also styled this version with better css, background image and media queries for use on different devices.
